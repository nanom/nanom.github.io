Hello! My name is Hernán and since 2021 I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [FaMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/) of the National University of Córdoba ([UNC](https://www.unc.edu.ar/)) advised by *[Dr. Luciana Benotti](https://benotti.github.io/)* with a doctoral scholarship awarded by the national agency for science ([CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/)).

In 2019 I obtained a Master's degree through the final project "*Artificial vision for the automatic recognition, in real time, of urban bus lines*" in which artificial vision techniques and image analysis were used with the aim of helping to people with visual impairment.

Currently my work is focused in the study of the intersection between modalities of vision and language, to be triyng to extend and adapt existing visual question answering (VQA) models to help blind people in their daily tasks. In particular, I am interested in the way to integrate optical character recognition with the understanding of referring expressions to be able to read and understand texts in images captured by these people.

I have recently begun to study in more detail the large language models. My last work was to create a tool that helps people outside of the computer science field to detect and expose the biases present in these models. And right now I'm fine-tuning a Bert model on the [VizWiz](https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/vqa/) dataset, in order to in a later step predict the skills that these VQA systems need to have to improve their responses.
