Hi! I am in my second year of the Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía, Física y Computación ([FAMAF](https://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/)) of the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba ([UNC](https://www.unc.edu.ar/)), advised by *[Dra. Luciana Benotti](https://benotti.github.io/)*, with a doctoral scholarship from the national agency for science ([CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/)). Before this, in 2019 I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science through the final work called [<i>Visión artificial para el reconocimiento automático, en tiempo real, de líneas urbanas de autobuses</i>]("#my_thesis").
Currently my work is focused in the study of the intersection between modalities of vision and language, to be triyng to extend and adapt existing visual question answering (VQA) models, with the intention of assisting people with vision impairments in their daily tasks. In particular, I am studying the way to integrate optical character recognition with referring expression comprehension to be able to read and understand texts in images captured by people with visual disabilities.
